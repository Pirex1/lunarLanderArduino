This is a game inspired by the 1979 Atari game "Lunar Lander". They used to have
a version of this in the Telus World of Science in Edmonton Alberta. As a kid i
would play it for hours while i was at the science center until my parents came
and forced me to do something else. I have also added some of my own features to
it that i think make the game more fun and challenging.

The basic concept of the game is too land the lunar ship on flat areas marked by
score boards. The harder the area to land, the more points you receive. The diff-
culty of this game comes from the limited fuel you posses on each run, which
is dependent on the difficulty selected at the start of the game. The physics
implemented are simple kinematic formulas that add to the realism of the game.

Features Added from Base Game:
1. Difficulty selector that changes starting fuel costs and some other variables
2. Colors and Sounds!!
3. Led that flash on the Arduino which correspond to low fuel

My goal was too work on this for a couple hours each week to both give myself a
break from studying and to make sure my coding skills improved over the
Christmas break between first and second semester.

Milestones:

26/11/2017- Began!
-The first phase of this project would be to get a working lunar lander that
can be controlled by the Arduino joystick. This would mean correctly implementing
the physics required & learning how to redraw the lander on the screen properly
for each frame.
