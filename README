This is a game inspired by the 1979 Atari game "Lunar Lander". They used to have
a version of this in the Telus World of Science in Edmonton Alberta. As a kid i
would play it for hours while i was at the science center until my parents came
and forced me to do something else. I have also added some of my own features to
it that i think make the game more fun and challenging.

The basic concept of the game is too land the lunar ship on flat areas marked by
score boards. The harder the area to land, the more points you receive. The diff-
culty of this game comes from the limited fuel you posses on each run, which
is dependent on the difficulty selected at the start of the game. The physics
implemented are simple kinematic formulas that add to the realism of the game.

Features Added from Base Game:
1. Difficulty selector that changes starting fuel costs and some other variables
2. Colors and Sounds!!
3. Led that flash on the Arduino which correspond to low fuel

My goal was too work on this for a couple hours each week to both give myself a
break from studying and to make sure my coding skills improved over the
Christmas break between first and second semester.

Wiring Instructions:

We only wire some of the pins. Your kit should only have pins on one side.
The other side has been rendered useless. They are for a different data transfer
mode that we will not use (8 bit). In fact, we have soldered some jumpers on the
back of the board to only allow the data transfer mode we will use (SPI,
the major benefit being it uses fewer wires).

!!! CAUTION !!!
The display itself uses 3.3v logic. The pins on the breakout board that we have
soldered use 5v logic and the board has a voltage converter to interact with
the display. Follow the wiring instructions below very carefully and do not
connect anything else.


Wiring: from bottom to top on the right side (the side with the pins).

Tip: Tie together the long wires that stretch across the board to keep things
organized. I used the twist tie that came with my USB cable.
